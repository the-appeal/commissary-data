# Locked In, Priced Out

The Appeal has created the first national database of prison commissary lists. Using the data in this repository, you can access full lists from the vast majority of U.S. states and see prices for many products available in prison. You can [read more about what we uncovered here](http://theappeal.org/locked-in-priced-out-how-much-prison-commissary-prices) and [how this database was built here](http://theappeal.org/locked-in-priced-out-commissary-database-methodology).

The data is split across three files:

- [`data/commissary-lists-20240417.csv`](data/commissary-lists-20240417.csv): Links and other metadata for commissary lists from each of the 46 states that provided records.
- [`data/commissary-summaries-20240417.csv`](data/commissary-summaries-20240417.csv): A state-by-state summary of the cost of basic food, hygiene, and other items selected by The Appeal.
- [`data/commissary-prices-20240417.csv`](data/commissary-prices-20240417.csv): Raw price data used in The Appealâ€™s analysis of 24 different food, hygiene, and religious products.

We will periodically update the data in this repository as we continue to receive new commissary lists and extract data from the lists we have.
